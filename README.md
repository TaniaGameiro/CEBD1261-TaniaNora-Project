Flavors of Cacao - Data Analysis in Python

## PROJECT TEAM
Tania Gameiro
Nora Arouchian
 
## RESULTS
In this analysis, there are thousands of chocolate bars rated from 63 countries. 
The most number of ratings that were given was between 3.0 to 3.5, with the highest being 3.5 with a number of around 380 ratings. 
This shows us that most individuals are giving chocolate bars a rating of a little bit more than satisfactory. (positively skewed) 

 
## EVALUATION
Project (70%):
#### Part 1: You will select a dataset of interest and integrate it into HDFS

[Flavors of Cocoa is the dataset chosen from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/chocolate-bar-ratings/data)

 
#### Part 2: Deploy the pipeline with the containers
See command line document in Github.

#### Part 3: Prepare two use cases either analytics or visualisation
See Python script in Github. 

#### Part 4: Do the project demo
##### What is the data you are working on
[Flavors of Cocoa is the dataset chosen from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/chocolate-bar-ratings/data)

##### What are you trying to do with it?
The questions that this case study will delve deeper into are: 
1) Which country has the highest chocolate consumption?
2) When were the reviews captured?
3) Is there a link between the cocoa percentage and the ratings?
4) Which countries have the highest ratings?
5) Which countries have the lowest ratings?


##### What are the results?
1) The data clearly shows that the US consumes chocolate far more than any other country of the world.
2) We can also see that most of the chocolate bars were reviewed in 2014-16, with the data collection starting in 2006, up until 2017. 
3) We were able to see that the average percent of cocoa in a chocolate bar is around 70%, and the average rating for the chocolate bars is 3.1. 
4) Both highest rated chocolate comes from Italy and both have 70% cocoa. 
5) Three out of four of the lowest rated chocolates are from Belgium, and all have either 70% or close to 70% cocoa percent. 

##### What challenges with the data and the process?
The quality of the data wasnâ€™t great, the format of the data was inconsistent. There were also multiple representations of the same data in the Specific Bean Origin column. 

For example the below all represent the same Specific Bean Origin, written in 5 different ways. 
+ Akesson's E., Sambirano V.
+ Akesson's Estate
+ Akessons Estate, Sambirano, 2013
+ Akessons Estate, Sambirano, Ambanja
+ Akesson's, batch 4411 

*We did not use this field for any of our analyses due to these types of inconsistencies.
